## Overview 
OMLA is an oracle-less attack on traditional logic locking which maps the problem of resolving the key-bit value to subgraph classification. OMLA extracts a small subgraph for each key-gate from the locked netlist. The enclosing subgraphs capture the characteristics associated with the key-bit values of the key-gates. Therefore, the label of a subgraph can also be considered the key-bit value.

## Requirement
Install PyTorch following the instuctions on the [official website] (https://pytorch.org/).
Then install the other dependencies (tqdm, numpy, and networkx)

## Netlist-to-subgraphs Conversion
### Datasets
The `./circuit_datasets/` directory contain an example dataset for the `c3540` benchmark. The dataset is implemented using the self-referencing scenario explained in the TCAS-II paper. The target `c3540` circuit is locked using random logic locking with K=64 and then re-synthesized using `Synopsys Design Compiler`. The target circuit is named `Test_c3540_syn_locked_rnd_64_1_syn.v`. The training/validation circuits are obtained by re-locking the test circuit with additional 64 key-bits and re-synthesizing.
When creating a dataset, the files used for training, validation, or testing must be identified. To split files into Test/Train/Validate, the files must be named accordingly. A locked file must be named as follows: [Test|Train|Validate]_*.v

### Conversion to Graphs
**Scripts**  
The following scripts are required for the conversion:  
`./TheCircuit.pm`: a Perl module we create to ease circuit's parsing. This module is required by our parser `netlist_to_subgraphs.pl`

`./netlist_to_subgraphs.pl` perl script reads the circuit dataset and converts the circuits into a single graph. The script also identifies the key-gates and the corresponding key-bit values, which will be used to train/test the GNN-based attack model. The circuits are expected to follow the Nangate 45nm Open Cell Library format. The script assigns unique numerical IDs (0 to N-1) to the nodes (gates). N represents the total number of nodes (gates) in the dataset. The list of nodes corresponding to the key-gates with a key-bit value of `0` in the training set will be dumped in `node_tr_pos.txt`, and the key-gates with a key-bit value of `1` will be dumped in `node_tr_neg.txt`. The list of key-gates in the testing set with a key-bit value of `0` will be dumped in `node_te_pos.txt`, while the ones with a key-bit value of `1` will be dumped in `node_te_neg.txt`. Same applies for the validation set. The extracted features will be dumped in `feat.txt`. The existence of an edge i between two vertices u and v is represented by the entry of ith line in `link.txt` (representing u's and v's IDs).

**Running the Conversion**   
1) Modify line 7 in `./netlist_to_subgraphs.pl` and place the full path to `theCircuit.pm`.
2) Perform the conversion:  
    ```sh
    $ cd ./circuit_datasets/
    $ unzip c3540.zip
    $ cd ../
    $ perl netlist_to_subgraphs.pl -f c3540 -i ./circuit_datasets/c3540   > log_build_OMLA_c3540.txt
    ```
The corresponding graph dataset will be dumped under ./data

## Subgraph Classification
To train the GIN network on the generated dataset:
```sh
$ python Main.py --split-val --use-dis --file-name c3540 --links-name link.txt  --batch_size 64  --filename Release_c3540_result_b64_h2_fan_6layers_hd64.txt  --  hidden_dim 64 --num_layers 6 > Release_log_c3540_b64_h2_6layers_hd64.txt
```
